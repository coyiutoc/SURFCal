# SURFCAL Calendar 
### CPSC 304 (Introduction to Relational Databases) Final Project

Project is a calendar web application that allows a user to view, add, update and delete calendar items of four types (event, task, reminder and note). Each user also has the ability to update contact items, in which each contact may have one or more emails, addresses or phones.

The application also allows users to login/logout of their account, and to update their name, birthday or password. If the logged in user is a site admin, there will be an additional page accessible showing statistics on the application (i.e the total number of items on a given Calendar, the number of contacts that a specific user has).
